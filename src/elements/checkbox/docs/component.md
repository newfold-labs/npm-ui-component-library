A checkbox is a graphical user interface element that can be used either as a single checkbox or in a list, and its usage can differ depending on the context and user's needs. 

**Single checkbox**<br>
A single checkbox is typically used for binary choices, such as:
 - **enabling** (checked) or **disabling** (unchecked) a setting
 - **agreeing** (checked) or **disagreeing** (unchecked) to a statement in the label that is placed directly to the right of the checkbox (e.g. agreeing to terms and conditions).

It presents the user with a clear and simple choice and allows them to make a single decision.

**Checkbox list**<br>
(see `Checkbox group` component)<br>
A checkbox list allows users to select one or more options from a list of choices, with each option represented by a separate checkbox. This type of checkbox is commonly used in forms, surveys, and other scenarios where the user needs to select one or more items.
