import { Root as NewfoldRoot, Button } from "@newfold/ui-component-library";

#### 1. Loading State
The loading state is used when a button click triggers a process that takes some time to complete,
such as running a data optimization or uploading a file.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button isLoading>Loading...</Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button isLoading>
    Loading...
</Button>
```

#### 2. Disabled State
The disabled state, represented by a transparent button, is used when the button cannot be clicked due to a certain condition.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button disabled>Disabled</Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button disabled>
    Disabled
</Button>
```

:::info

The disabled state does not remove pointer-events. If you want to remove pointer-events, you can use the `className` prop to add a class that sets pointer-events to none.

:::

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button
        className="nfd-pointer-events-none"
        disabled
    >
        Disabled & without pointer-events
    </Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button
    className="nfd-pointer-events-none"
    disabled
>
    Disabled & without pointer-events
</Button>
```
