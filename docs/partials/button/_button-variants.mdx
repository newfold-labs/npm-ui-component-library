import { Root as NewfoldRoot, Button } from "@newfold/ui-component-library";

#### 1. Primary (default)
Primary buttons are used to highlight the most important action or call to action on a page or screen.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button>Primary (default)</Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button>
    Primary (default)
</Button>
```

#### 2. Secondary
Secondary buttons are used to offer secondary or supplementary actions to users that are less important than the primary action.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary">
    Secondary
</Button>
```

#### 3. Error
Error buttons are used to warn users of potentially hazardous or irreversible actions.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button variant="error">Error</Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button variant="error">
    Error
</Button>
```

#### 4. Upsell
Upsell buttons are used to indicate the start of a flow that eventually leads to a purchase, subscription or upgrade.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <Button variant="upsell">Upsell</Button>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<Button variant="Upsell">
    Upsell
</Button>
