import PropsTable from '@site/src/components/PropsTable';
import { Root as NewfoldRoot, ErrorBoundary } from "@newfold/ui-component-library";

# Error Boundary
React component that catches errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors,
and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

---
### Usage
```jsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "@newfold/ui-component-library";

<ErrorBoundary
    fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}
>
    <App />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
