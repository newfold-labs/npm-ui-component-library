# Root
The `Root` component provides your React tree with a `RootContext` which contains general options such as `isRtl` to indicate right to left language direction. It also provides a `.yst-root` CSS class for scoping our CSS in opinionated environments. You can use the `RootContext` by using the `useRootContext` hook exported from `@yoast/ui-library/hooks`.

Please note that the CSS scoping adds one level of CSS specificity. Therefore `@yoast/tailwindcss-preset` does the following:

1. Enables the `important` rule for all utilities.
1. Disables the Tailwind `preflight` styles (as they are included in the `Root` component's CSS).
1. Configures `@tailwindcss/forms` to use the `class` strategy (they are included in the `Root` component's CSS).

<NewfoldRoot>
    <p>Root Contents</p>
</NewfoldRoot>
