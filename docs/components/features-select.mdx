# FeaturesSelect
The `FeaturesSelect` component provides a flexible way to create checkbox or radio-based feature selection cards.

<NewfoldRoot>

</NewfoldRoot>

### Usage
```jsx
import { FeaturesSelect } from "@newfold/ui-component-library";

<FeaturesSelect>
    <FeaturesSelect.Feature
        id="feature-1"
        name="feature-group"
        value="1"
    >
        Feature 1
    </FeaturesSelect.Feature>

    <FeaturesSelect.Feature
        id="feature-2"
        name="feature-group"
        value="2"
    >
        Feature 2
    </FeaturesSelect.Feature>

    <FeaturesSelect.Feature
        id="feature-3"
        name="feature-group"
        value="3"
    >
        Feature 3
    </FeaturesSelect.Feature>
</FeaturesSelect>
```

As shown in the example above, the `FeaturesSelect` component wraps a set of `FeaturesSelect.Feature` components. The `FeaturesSelect` can be used as container to control the behavior and layout of the features while each `FeaturesSelect.Feature` component represents an option card that can be selected by the user.

---
### Behavior
You can use the `behavior` prop in the `FeaturesSelect` component to specify whether the feature cards should behave as checkboxes or radio buttons. The default behavior is `checkbox`.
<FeaturesSelectBehavior />

---
### Layout
You can use the `layout` prop in the `FeaturesSelect` component to specify the layout of the feature cards. There are two layout options: 'row' and 'column'. The default layout is 'row'.
<FeaturesSelectLayout />

---
### Props
<PropsTable.Table docs={featuresSelectProps} />

---
## FeaturesSelect.Feature
The `FeaturesSelect.Feature` component is used to create a feature card that can be selected by the user.

```jsx
import { FeaturesSelect } from "@newfold/ui-component-library";

<FeaturesSelect.Feature
    id="feature-1"
    name="feature-group"
    value="1"
    className="nfd-w-fit"
>
    Feature 1
</FeaturesSelect.Feature>
```

---
### Label
Use the `label` prop to render a label under the feature card.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <FeaturesSelect.Feature
        id="feature-1-label"
        name="feature-group"
        value="1"
        className="nfd-w-fit"
        label="Feature 1"
    >
        Feature 1 with label
    </FeaturesSelect.Feature>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<FeaturesSelect.Feature
    id="feature-1"
    name="feature-group"
    value="1"
    className="nfd-w-fit"
    label="Feature 1"
>
    Feature 1 with label
</FeaturesSelect.Feature>
```

---
### Disabled
Use the `disabled` prop to disable the feature card.

<NewfoldRoot>
    <FeaturesSelect.Feature
        id="feature-1-disabled"
        name="feature-group"
        value="1"
        className="nfd-w-fit"
        disabled
    >
        Feature 1
    </FeaturesSelect.Feature>
</NewfoldRoot>

```jsx
<FeaturesSelect.Feature
    id="feature-1"
    name="feature-group"
    value="1"
    className="nfd-w-fit"
    disabled
>
    Feature 1
</FeaturesSelect.Feature>
```
