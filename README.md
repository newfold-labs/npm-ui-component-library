# WordPress Newfold UI Starter Plugin
Newfold UI components can be used to build WordPress admin pages when developing plugins with React.

This branch serves as a starter template for a plugin that uses React, TailwindCSS and Newfold UI. You can use it as a starting point or as a guide if you're looking to install and configure Newfold UI in your plugin.

## Installation
Start by cloning the the code from the starter template:

```bash
git clone -b wp-newfold-ui-starter https://github.com/newfold-labs/npm-ui-component-library.git
```

Then run `npm run build`.

**Tip:** run `npm start` to automatically rebuild your changes on save during development.
