# Newfold UI ViteJS Starter Template
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

This branch serves as a starter template for a Vite project that uses React, TailwindCSS and Newfold UI. You can use it as a starting point or as a guide if you're looking to install and configure Newfold UI in your Vite project.

## Installation
Start by cloning the code from the starter template:

```bash
git clone -b starter/vitejs https://github.com/newfold-labs/npm-ui-component-library.git
```

Then run `npm i && npm run dev` to start the dev server.

Visit the application local page.
